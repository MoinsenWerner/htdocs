                <p><strong>Authoritative legal bases according to the GDPR: </strong>Below you will find an overview of the legal bases of the GDPR on the basis of which we process personal data. Please note that in addition to the
                    regulations of the GDPR, national data protection regulations may apply in your or our country of residence or domicile. Should more specific legal bases also apply in individual cases, we will inform you of these in the privacy policy
                    with.

                        purposes.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Contract fulfillment and pre-contractual requests (Art. 6 para. 1 p.1 lit. b) GDPR)</strong> - The processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party or in order to take steps at the request of the data subject prior to entering into a contract. measures which are carried out at the request of the data subject.</li>

                </ul>
                <p><strong>National data protection regulations in Germany: </strong>In addition to the data protection regulations of the GDPR, national data protection regulations apply in Germany. These include, in particular, the law on protection against misuse of personal data during data processing (Federal Data Protection Act - BDSG). In particular, the BDSG contains special regulations on the right to information, the right to erasure, the right to object, the processing of special categories of categories of personal data, processing for other purposes, transmission and automated decision-making in individual cases, including profiling. Furthermore, the data protection laws of the individual federal states may apply.</p>
                <p><strong>Reference to validity of GDPR and Swiss DPA: </strong>This data protection notice serves to provide information in accordance with both the Swiss Data Protection Act (DSG) and the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). For this reason, we ask you to note that the terms of the GDPR are used due to the broader geographical application and comprehensibility. In particular, instead of the terms “processing” of “personal data”, “overriding interest” and “particularly interest” and ‘sensitive personal data’, the terms ‘processing’ of ‘personal data’ and ‘legitimate interest’ and ‘special categories of data’ used in the GDPR are used. The legal  meaning of the terms will, however, continue to be determined in accordance with the Swiss DPA within the scope of application of the Swiss DPA.</p>
                <h2 id="m27">Security measures</h2>
                <p>We take appropriate technical and organizational measures in accordance with the legal requirements, taking into account the state of the art, the implementation costs and the nature, scope, circumstances and purposes of the processing as well as the different probabilities of occurrence and the extent of the threat to the rights and freedoms of natural persons, in order to ensure a level of protection appropriate to the risk.</p>
                <p>The measures include, in particular, safeguarding the confidentiality, integrity and availability of data by controlling physical and electronic access to the data as well as the access, input, disclosure, safeguarding of availability and its separation. Furthermore, we have established procedures that ensure the exercise of data subject rights, the deletion of data and responses to data threats. Furthermore, we already take the protection of personal data into account during the development or selection of hardware, software and processes in accordance with the principle of data protection, through technology design and through data protection-friendly default settings.
                </p>
                <p>Securing online connections using TLS/SSL encryption technology (HTTPS): To protect user data transmitted via our online services from unauthorized access, we use TLS/SSL encryption technology. Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS) are the cornerstones of secure data transmission on the Internet. These technologies encrypt the information transmitted between the website or app and the user's browser (or between two servers), protecting the data from unauthorized access. TLS, as the more advanced and secure version of SSL, ensures that all data transmissions meet the highest security standards. If a website is secured by an SSL/TLS certificate, this is signaled by the display of HTTPS in the URL. This serves as an indicator to users that their data is being transmitted securely and encrypted.</p>
                <h2 id="m25">Transmission of personal data</h2>
                <p>As part of our processing of personal data, it may be transmitted to other bodies, companies, legally independent organizational units or persons or disclosed to them. The recipients of this data may include, for example, service providers commissioned with IT tasks or providers of services and content that are integrated into a website. In such cases, we comply with the legal requirements and conclude appropriate contracts or agreements with the recipients of your data that serve to protect your data.</p>
                <p>Data transfer within the organization: Data transfer within the group of companies: We may transfer personal data to other companies within our group of companies or grant them access to it. If the data transfer is for administrative purposes, it is based on our legitimate business and commercial interests or takes place if it is necessary for the fulfillment of our contractual obligations or if the consent of the data subjects or legal permission exists. contractual obligations or if the consent of the data subject or legal permission has been obtained.</p>

<p>Cookies are small text files or other storage markers that store and retrieve information on end devices. For example, they can be used to store the login status in a user account, the contents of a shopping cart in an e-shop, or the accessed content or used functions of an online service. Cookies can also be used for various purposes, such as ensuring the functionality, security, and comfort of online services, as well as for creating analyses of visitor flows.</p>
<p><strong>Notes on consent: </strong>We use cookies in accordance with legal requirements. Therefore, we obtain prior consent from users unless it is not required by law. Consent is particularly not necessary if the storage and retrieval of information, including cookies, is strictly necessary to provide a telemedia service (i.e., our online service) explicitly requested by the users. The revocable consent is clearly communicated to them and includes information on the respective cookie usage.</p>
<p><strong>Notes on data protection legal bases: </strong>The legal basis on which we process the users' personal data using cookies depends on whether we ask for their consent. If users agree, the processing of their data is based on the given consent. Otherwise, the data processed through cookies is handled on the basis of our legitimate interests (e.g., the business operation of our online service and the improvement of its usability) or, if the use of cookies is necessary to fulfill our contractual obligations, when their use is required to meet our contractual obligations.

<p>In the case of end-to-end encryption of content (i.e., the content of your message and attachments), we point out that the communication content (i.e., the message content and attached images) is encrypted end-to-end. This means that the content of the messages is not visible, not even to the messenger providers themselves.

<h2 id="m263">Web Analysis, Monitoring, and Optimization</h2>
<p>Web analysis (also referred to as "reach measurement") is used to evaluate visitor flows on our online offering and may include behavior, interests, or demographic information about visitors, such as age or gender, as pseudonymous values. Using reach measurement, we can, for example, identify when our online offering or its functions or content are most frequently used or invite repeated use. It also allows us to understand which areas need improvement.</p>
<p>In addition to web analysis, we may also use testing procedures to test and optimize different versions of our online offering or its components.</p>
<p>Unless otherwise specified, profiles can be created for these purposes by compiling data related to a usage process, and information may be stored in a browser or on a device and then retrieved. The collected information includes, in particular, visited websites and used elements, as well as technical information such as the browser used, the computer system used, and usage times. If users have agreed to the collection of their location data by us or by the providers of the services we use, the processing of location data is also possible.</p>
<p>Furthermore, users' IP addresses are stored. However, we use an IP masking procedure (i.e., pseudonymization by shortening the IP address) to protect users. Generally, clear data of users (such as email addresses or names) are not stored in the context of web analysis, A/B testing, and optimization, but rather pseudonyms. This means that neither we nor the providers of the software used know the actual identity of the users, only the information stored in their profiles for the purposes of the respective procedures.</p>

    <li><strong>Google Analytics: </strong>We use Google Analytics to measure and analyze the usage of our online offering based on a pseudonymous user identification number. This identification number does not contain unique data such as names or email addresses. It serves to associate analysis information with a device to determine which content users have accessed within one or several usage sessions, which search terms they used, revisited, or interacted with in our online offering. Additionally, the time and duration of usage are stored, as well as the sources of users referring to our online offering and technical aspects of their devices and browsers.<br>Pseudonymous profiles of users may be created using information from the use of various devices, with cookies being deployed. Google Analytics does not log or store individual IP addresses for EU users. However, Analytics provides approximate geographic location data by deriving the following metadata from IP addresses: city (and derived city latitude and longitude), continent, country, region, subcontinent (and ID-based counterparts). For EU data traffic, IP address data is used exclusively for this geolocation derivation and then immediately deleted. The IP data is not logged, not accessible, and not used for further purposes. When Google Analytics collects measurement data, all IP lookups are conducted on EU-based servers before traffic is forwarded to Analytics servers for processing; <strong>Service provider:</strong> Google Ireland Limited, Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland; <span class=""><strong>Legal basis:</strong> Consent (Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. a) GDPR); </span><strong>Website:</strong> <a href="https://marketingplatform.google.com/intl/en/about/analytics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://marketingplatform.google.com/intl/en/about/analytics/</a>; <strong>Security measures:</strong> IP masking (pseudonymization

<h2 id="m136">Social Media Presence</h2>
<p>We maintain online presences within social networks and process user data in this context to communicate with users active there or to offer information about us.</p>
<p>We point out that user data may be processed outside the European Union. This can present risks for users, for example, by making it more difficult to enforce users' rights.</p>
<p>Furthermore, user data within social networks is typically processed for market research and advertising purposes. For example, user behavior and resulting interests can be used to create usage profiles. These profiles may be used to display advertisements inside and outside the networks that are presumably aligned with users' interests. Typically, cookies are stored on users' devices, in which user behavior and interests are stored. Additionally, data in user profiles may be stored independently of the devices used by the users (especially if they are members of the respective platforms and logged in).</p>
<p>For detailed information on the respective forms of processing and opt-out options, we refer to the privacy policies and notices of the operators of the respective networks.</p>
<p>In cases of information requests and the assertion of data subject rights, we also point out that these are best addressed to the providers. Only they have access to the user data and can directly take appropriate measures and provide information. If you still need assistance, you can contact us.</p>

<h2 id="m328">Plug-ins and Embedded Features and Content</h2>
<p>We integrate function and content elements into our online offering that are retrieved from the servers of their respective providers (hereinafter referred to as "third-party providers"). These may include, for example, graphics, videos, or city maps (hereinafter uniformly referred to as "content").</p>
<p>The integration always requires that the third-party providers of this content process the users' IP address, as they could not send the content to their browser without the IP address. The IP address is thus necessary for displaying these contents or functions. We strive to use only content whose respective providers use the IP address solely to deliver the content. Third-party providers may also use so-called pixel tags (invisible graphics, also known as "web beacons") for statistical or marketing purposes. The "pixel tags" can be used to evaluate information, such as visitor traffic on the pages of this website. The pseudonymous information may also be stored in cookies on the users' devices and may contain, among other things, technical information about the browser and operating system, referring websites, visit time, and other details about the use of our online offering, as well as being linked with such information from other sources.</p>
<p><strong>Legal basis information:</strong> If we ask users for their consent to use third-party providers, the legal basis for data processing is consent. Otherwise, user data is processed based on our legitimate interests (i.e., interest in efficient, economical, and user-friendly services). In this context, we also refer you to the information on the use of cookies in this privacy policy.</p>

    <li><strong>Google Fonts (retrieval from Google server): </strong>Retrieval of fonts (and icons) for the purpose of technically secure, maintenance-free, and efficient use of fonts and icons with regard to up-to-date versions, load times, their uniform display, and consideration of possible licensing restrictions. The font provider is informed of the user’s IP address to provide the fonts in the user’s browser. Additionally, technical data (language settings, screen resolution, operating system, hardware used) is transmitted, which is necessary for providing the fonts depending on the devices and the technical environment used. This data may be processed on the font provider's server in the USA—When visiting our online offering, users' browsers send their browser HTTP requests to the Google Fonts Web API (i.e., a software interface for retrieving the fonts). The Google Fonts Web API provides users with the Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) for Google Fonts and then the fonts specified in the CSS. These HTTP requests include (1) the IP address used by the respective user to access the internet, (2) the requested URL on the Google server, and (3) the HTTP headers, including the user agent, which describes the browser and operating system versions of the website visitors, as well as the referrer URL (i.e., the webpage where the Google font is to be displayed). IP addresses are neither logged nor stored on Google servers, and they are not analyzed. The Google Fonts Web API logs details of the HTTP requests (requested URL, user agent, and referrer URL). Access to this data is restricted and strictly controlled. The requested URL identifies the font families the user wants to load. This data is logged to help Google determine how often a specific font family is requested. For the Google Fonts Web API, the user agent must adjust the font generated for the respective browser type. The user agent is primarily logged and used for debugging and to generate aggregated usage statistics that measure the popularity of font families. These aggregated usage statistics are published on the "Analytics" page of Google Fonts. Finally, the referrer URL is logged so that the data can be used for production maintenance and to generate an aggregate report of the top integrations based on the number of font requests. According to Google, none of the information collected by Google Fonts is used to create profiles of end users or to display targeted ads; <strong>Service provider:</strong> Google Ireland Limited, Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland; <span class=""><strong>Legal basis:</strong> Legitimate interests (Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f) GDPR); </span><strong>Website:</strong> <a href="https://fonts.google.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://fonts.google.com/</a>; <strong>Privacy policy:</strong> <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://policies.google.com/privacy</a>;
